## Introduction to AtliQ Hardware:
**Domain:** Consumer Goods | **Functions:** Finance & Supply Chain

- AtliQ Hardwares is company that sells computer hardware and peripherals like PC, mouse, printer etc. to clients across the world.
- They have a major B2B business model wherein they sell to stores like Croma, Best Buy, Staples, Flipkart etc. who then sell it to the end users (consumers). These stores are their main customers.
- They sell through 3 channels: Retailer, Direct and Distributor.
- AtliQ Hardwaresâ€™s Customers are of two types. Both these Platforms are called Retailer channels.
  1. Brick & Mortar Customer: Actual physical stores e.g. Croma, Best Buy
  2. E-commerce Customer: Online websites E.g. Amazon, Flipkart
- AtliQ Hardwares also has a minor B2C business model wherein they own stores: AtliQ E-store and AtliQ Exclusive. These are called Direct channels.
- They also have Distributors in some countries with restricted trade. E.g. Neptune

## Project Objective:
Business growth analysis is essential for any company that wants to remain competitive and successful in the long term.

The goal is to write effective SQL queries to answer 10 ad-hoc business requests from the Data Analytics Director, aiming to secure valuable insights into the consumer goods sector. By fulfilling these different ad-hoc requests, I delivered specific answers to important business questions enabling the company to understand its product portfolio, sales trends across diverse customer segments and a monthly overview of products sold.

## Tools used:
1. MySQL Workbench - for Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, Normalization and Analysis process
2. Datawrapper - to create data visualizations
3. Miro - to create Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
4. Powerpoint - to create project presentation
5. GitHub - for documentation

## Skills & Methodologies implemented:
1. Data Cleaning - **CRUD Operations**
2. Data Manipulation - **Sub Queries, CTEs (Common Table Expression), Views, Temporary tables, Window Functions, UDFs (User-defined Functions), Stored Procedures and Database Triggers**
3. Database Modelling and Normalization - **ERD**
4. Exploratory Data Analysis - **Selection, Filtering, Aggregation, Grouping, Joining, Conditional Expressions**
5. Data Visualization
6. Documentation
